        <p>1. Mince the garlic cloves and cut the parsley.<br><br/>
           2. Mix the minced garlic and parsley in melted butter. This will imbue the flavor of garlic to the butter and serve as a spread.<br><br/>

           4. Cut American Cheese and cheddar into slices.<br><br/>
           5. Pan-fry the bacon stripes until crisps to create bacon fat. Do not have to oil the surface of the pan.<br><br/>
           6. Remove bacon crisps from pan and spread garlic butter on 2 slices of bread.<br><br/>
           7. Sear the bread until golden brown with bacon fat. Then cut the bacon into small pieces.<br><br/>
           8. Place all of the ingredients on the bread slices and stack them altogether while in the pan.<br><br/>
           9. After the cheese has melted, remove the sandwich from the pan.<br><br/>
          10. Enjoy it as you like.<br/></p>
